## Ingredients:  

8 Tablespoons unsalted butter softened to room temperature
1 cup granulated sugar
2 large egg yolks
1 teaspoon vanilla extract
1/2 teaspoon almond extract
1 1/2 cups all purpose flour
1/2 teaspoon baking powder
1/4 teaspoon salt
1/3 cup white chocolate chips
1/4 cup sprinkles for rolling

## Instructions:  

1. Preheat oven to 350 degrees F. Line cookie sheet with parchment paper or silicone baking mat.

2. In the bowl of a stand mixer using the paddle attachment, cream the butter and sugar together on medium speed until light and fluffy, about 3 minutes. Add the egg yolks, vanilla extract, and almond extract and beat until a dough forms.

3. Add the flour, baking powder, salt, and white chocolate chips to the 
dough and mix until combined. You may need to do the final mixing by hand as 
the dough will be thick.

4. Roll dough into tablespoon-sized balls and then roll dough balls in the 
sprinkles. Cookies will spread thin as they cook so make sure theyâ€™re 
spread about 2 inches a part. 

5. Bake in preheated oven for 7-10 minutes and remove when set but not yet turning brown.

6. Allow cookies to remain on hot baking sheet for a couple of minutes and then transfer to wire cooling rack.
