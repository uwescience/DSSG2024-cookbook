## Roast Cauliflower Shawarma and Pita By Melissa Clark, New York Times 

In this vegetarian take on shawarma, the usual spiced lamb, chicken or turkey is replaced with cauliflower florets and onion wedges that have been tossed with a classic combination of cumin, paprika and coriander, then roasted until browned, fragrant and very tender. To serve it, you can tuck everything into a pita or flatbread, or keep the bread on the side and let everyone assemble their own sandwiches at the table. Chopped cucumber, tomatoes and olives are optional, but they add a juicy brightness to contrast with the aromatic, roasted flavors. I serve with a tzatziki sauce.

Total Time 45 minutes 

### INGREDIENTS 
Yield: 2 servings 

FOR THE CAULIFLOWER 
5 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil, plus more as needed 
1¼ teaspoons ground cumin 
1¼ teaspoons sweet paprika
¾ teaspoon fine sea or table salt, plus more as needed 
1 teaspoon ground coriander 
¼ teaspoon ground turmeric 
¼ teaspoon freshly ground black pepper 
Pinch of ground cayenne 
1 large head cauliflower (about 2½ pounds), trimmed and cut into bitesize florets
1 large red onion, cut into ¼-inch wedges 

Pita or flatbread, for serving 
¼ cup coarsely chopped parsley, plus more for serving
Chopped tomato, cucumber and olives
Tzatziki sauce 

### PREPARATION 

Step 1 Arrange racks in the upper and lower thirds of your oven. Heat oven to 425 degrees. 

Step 2 Prepare the cauliflower: In a large bowl, whisk together olive oil, cumin, paprika, salt, coriander, turmeric, black pepper and cayenne. Add cauliflower and onion, and toss until well coated. Spread mixture in a single layer on a rimmed baking sheet. 

Step 3 Roast vegetables on the top oven rack until they are golden brown, slightly crisp and tender, 30 to 40 minutes, stirring once or twice. If the vegetables look dry as they roast, drizzle with a little more olive oil. 

Step 4 Warm the pitas or flatbread by placing them directly on the bottom oven rack during the last 5 minutes as the vegetables roast. (Or you can warm the bread on another baking pan if that’s easier for you.) 

Step 5 Scatter parsley on top of the roasted vegetables and serve with warm pitas, tahini sauce, chopped tomato, cucumber and olives.
