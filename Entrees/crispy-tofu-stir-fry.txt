Crispy Tofu Stir Fry

Ingredients:
1. Half a packet of tofu
2. Soy sauce (3 tablespoons)
3. Sesame oil (2 teaspoons)
4. White Sesame seeds 
5. Gochujang/Chilli flakes 
6. Honey (2 tablespoons)
7. Cornstarch 
8. Water
9. Veggies - Beans, Broccoli, Babycorn, Carrots
10. Spring onion
11. Salt
12. Ginger garlic paste
13. Apple cider vinegar (1 teaspoon)

To do:
1. Prepare tofu by pressing, boiling or freezing it. I personally press it with a cast iron pan for 15 minutes. Cube the tofu and toss it with salt and a tablespoon of cornstarch in a ziplock bag
2. Chop veggies stir fry style - long and thin
3. Fry the tofu on a pan or an air fryer. I do it on a pan with ~3 minutes on each side.
4. On the side prepare the sauce - mix a teaspoon of cornstarch, ginger garlic paste and gochujang first and then add liquid ingredients soy sauce, sesame oil, honey, apple cider vinegar and a little bit of water. Adjust quantity of ingredients according to personal preferences.
5. Add two tablespoons of the sauce to the fried tofu, coat the tofu and remove to a plate 
6. In the same pan, fry the veggies and the white parts of spring onions in butter
7. Add back the tofu and pour the entire sauce. Adjust “sauciness” by adding water if needed. Simmer for ~5 minutes 
8. Remove from heat and top with sesame seeds and green parts of spring onions
9. Serve over rice
