### Ingredients:

- 4 boneless, skinless chicken thighs, cut into bite-sized pieces
- 200g mushrooms (shiitake, button, or any variety you prefer), sliced
- 1 onion, sliced
- 3 cloves garlic, minced
- 1 inch ginger, minced
- 2 tablespoons soy sauce
- 1 tablespoon oyster sauce
- 1 tablespoon Shaoxing wine (or dry sherry)
- 1 tablespoon cornstarch
- 1 teaspoon sesame oil
- 2 tablespoons vegetable oil (for stir-frying)
- Salt and pepper to taste
- Optional: sliced green onions for garnish, baking soda

### Instructions:

1. **Marinate the Chicken**: In a bowl, combine the chicken pieces with soy sauce, Shaoxing wine, cornstarch, and sesame oil. Mix well and let it marinate for at least 15-20 minutes. If you want to make the chicken tender, you can also do a pre-step of the marination with baking soda (marinated for 5 minutes and wash away the baking soda)
2. **Prepare the Wok**: Heat the vegetable oil in a Chinese wok over high heat until it's very hot but not smoking.
3. **Cook Aromatics**: In the same wok, add a bit more oil if needed. Add the minced garlic and ginger, and stir-fry for about 30 seconds until fragrant.
4. **Stir-Fry Chicken**: Add the marinated chicken to the wok, spreading it out in a single layer. Let it sear without stirring for about 1-2 minutes to get a nice golden color. Then, stir-fry continuously until the chicken is cooked through. Remove the chicken from the wok and set it aside.
5. **Add Vegetables**: Add the sliced mushrooms and onions to the wok. Stir-fry for another 2-3 minutes until they start to soften.
6. **Combine & Season**: Return the cooked chicken to the wok. Mix everything together. Add oyster sauce and season with salt and pepper to taste. Stir well to combine all the flavors.
7. **Final Touches**: If the sauce is too thick, you can add a splash of water or chicken broth to loosen it up. Stir for another minute until everything is heated through and well combined.
8. **Serve**: Transfer the mushroom chicken thigh stir-fry to a serving dish. Garnish with sliced green onions if desired. Serve hot with steamed rice or noodles.
