Chole (Indian chickpea curry)

Ingredients:
2 cups canned chickpeas (drained and rinsed)
2 tablespoons oil
1 large onion, finely chopped
2 tomatoes, finely chopped
1 tablespoon ginger-garlic paste
1 green chili, slit (optional)
1 teaspoon cumin seeds
1/2 teaspoon turmeric powder
1 teaspoon coriander powder
1 teaspoon cumin powder
1 teaspoon garam masala
1 teaspoon red chili powder (adjust to taste)
Salt to taste
Fresh coriander leaves for garnish
1 teaspoon amchur (dry mango powder) or a squeeze of lemon juice (optional)
2 cups water
Instructions:
Heat the Oil: In a large pan, heat the oil over medium heat. Add the cumin seeds and let them sizzle for a few seconds.

Sauté Onions and Spices: Add the chopped onions and sauté until they turn golden brown. Add the ginger-garlic paste and green chili, cooking for another minute.

Add Tomatoes and Dry Spices: Add the chopped tomatoes along with turmeric, coriander, cumin, and red chili powders. Cook until the tomatoes are completely mushy and oil starts leaving the sides of the mixture.

Cook the Chickpeas: Add the chickpeas, salt, and water. Bring the mixture to a boil, then reduce the heat and simmer for about 10-15 minutes, allowing the flavors to meld.

Add Garam Masala and Amchur: Stir in garam masala and amchur (or lemon juice). Cook for another 5 minutes.

Garnish and Serve: Garnish with freshly chopped coriander leaves. Serve hot with rice or any Indian bread like roti, naan, or bhature.
