Mushroom “Brisket” Recipe 

Ingredients
- 2-3 portabello mushrooms per person 
- 1 container vegetable or mushroom broth
- 1 bottle fruity red wine 
- 1-2 parsnips
- 1 bag frozen pearl onions
- Plenty of thick carrots
- 1-2 dried or canned chipotle peppers
- A couple handfuls of prunes
- Salt
- Pepper
- Paprika


Steps
1) Preheat oven to 450 F. Clean the mushrooms and remove stems. Place the mushrooms gills up a baking sheet. Cover mushrooms in olive oil.
2) Roast mushrooms at 450 F for about 25 minutes. 
3) While the mushrooms are roasting, boil wine in an oven-safe pot until it’s reduced by about 25%. Add broth and reduce by another 25%. 
4) Add chili peppers, salt, pepper, and a few tablespoons of paprika to the wine and broth and let it simmer gently. 
5) Cut the mushrooms approximately half-inch to 1-inch wide slices, approximating brisket slices. Add to the pot along with prunes and onions. Let simmer.
6) Peel and slice carrots and parsnips into 1/4 thick disks. Add on top of mushrooms. 
7) Set oven to 325 F. Place the pot, tightly covered, in the oven. Let roast for approximately 2.5 hours, checking every half hour, until parsnips and carrots are tender but the mushrooms are still firm. 
8) Serve immediately or store in the fridge and reheat on the stove top. If there’s too much gravy, reduce on the stove. If there’s too much gravy, reduce on the stove.
9) Enjoy!
