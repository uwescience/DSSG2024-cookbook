## The Cooking Process:
Chop tomatoes, onions, bell pepper, ginger, garlic, scotch bonnet pepper and puree in a blender/food processor.
Cook the pureed mixture in a pot with hot cooking oil over medium-high heat. Stir together and place a lid over it, reduce heat to low, and simmer for 20 minutes.

Place a piece of aluminium foil into the pot, covering the entire surface of the rice, then place a lid over the pot. Cook for 20 minutes on low heat (stirring occasionally).
Remove the lid, bin the aluminium foil and give the rice a gentle stir, then return the lid and cook for another 5 minutes.
